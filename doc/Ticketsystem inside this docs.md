# Why a own Ticket System? There is Github and Stuff
This is a test, if it is possible to keep track of a project using the version control mechanisms of the project itself.
Because I use [[GIT]] for this project, I though I could maybe create Markdown Files for Each Ticket.

## This could look this way:

``` markdown
# What is the Idea?

## Description and additional Context
A Short description what you thought about and how this could be achived.
First thoughts and impressions can be summarized in a "## Story"

## Story
### The second thing was how I would integrate this `[[Ticketsystem]]` inside the docs itself
If I want to use a semantic network for the documentation of the project itself, then I should also use this same semantic network for the `[[Ticketsystem]]`. 
I link the `Ticketsystem` and the Explanation of the `[[Ticketsystem]]` itself to the first entrypoint of this project.

### This is the first thing when I think about this Idea
Describe here, what you first thought and how to achive this.
For example I think that this project could make good use of a good documentation.
[[So first I asked gpt4 about how I could create maybe a textbased system for tickets inside a project]]
