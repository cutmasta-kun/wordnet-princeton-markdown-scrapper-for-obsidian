# It seems this Project is named wordnet-princeton-markdown-scrapper-for-obsidian
With this, you can generate your first Knowledge Graph with [WordNet Lexica Datasets](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) and [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

Here is some text found their websites:

> " WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing." 

> "Everything is connected; The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.; In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph."

## Introduction
Something something about me, why I did this and why I didn't learned a job in a woodworking facility or craftmanship.
I guess I'm interested in the concept of `thinking` itself and having Ideas.
So now I'm indexing the whole world to a huge knowledge base and everyone following this project can watch how I either:
- [x] abandon this project
- [ ] get insane
- [ ] win a nobel prize someday

## What is **THIS** specifically?
**THIS** is the entry to the documentation of this project. I'm trying the semantic network approach and for this I thought about a kind of [[Ticketsystem inside this docs]]. 
This way the project itself becomes a semantic network \(@^0^@)/ 
Let's see how deep I can go...

### This is the Entrypoint
This File here should be the first point to look, when entering the project documentation.
This File should be linked to almost every aspect of this project, even the Idea of the `[[Ticketsystem | Ticketsystem inside this docs]]` itself
